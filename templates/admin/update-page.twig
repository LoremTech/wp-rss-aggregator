                    <h3>Introducing Templates</h3>
                    <p>
                        WP RSS Aggregator’s feed item display has always been limited to a few display options in the
                        general settings. Those days are gone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Templates enable you to create as many variations of the feed item display as you wish, all
                        with different options. Each one can be used anywhere across your site. So, if you’d like to
                        have a simple list view in your sidebar, you can do that. If you want a more stylish display for
                        your homepage, you can do that too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As of right now, there is still only one template type available (the "List" type). This has
                        replaced the “Display Settings” that were previously found under RSS Aggregator > Settings in
                        your dashboard. In fact, existing users will notice that their display settings are now
                        replicated in the “Default” template.
                    </p>

                    <h3>A Brand New Gutenberg Block</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our brand new Gutenberg block titled “WP RSS Aggregator Feeds” makes setting up a display
                        of your feed items super simple. Search for the block, add it to your page or post, choose the
                        options you want for this particular page or post, and you’re all set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have implemented a live preview in the block, so as you select or hide sources, select
                        templates, set limits, and so on, you’re seeing exactly what your visitors will see on your site
                        without ever leacing the edit page. We also introduced a new “Page” option that allows you to 
                        display different pages of a feed's items in multiple columns, boxes, or any other area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those using the classic WordPress editor, we have also updated our TinyMCE button. Look for
                        the RSS button in the editor and you'll see the same options as those provided in the block.

                    <h3>More Powerful Logs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Debug logs are vital when trying to narrow down the cause of any problem. In this version we
                        have updated our error logging and introduced a new debug log interface that will make it easier
                        for you, and for our support team, to filter through the log entries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The logs are now also stored in your database, not in a single large text file. This makes it
                        more reliable, speeds up the logging, and ensures that your site isn’t bogged down by any large
                        error log file.
                    </p>
